hello my name is Rell I didn't study informatics so I don't understand coding I just tried it,
This code is open to public and I'm still developing it to add to my knowledge of coding,
I will still be updating the code maybe once a week. I didn't know this code had the theme of the Rdp Store,
To see what I added to the code please have a look at the update logs
if you experience an error on netlify you can't build open terminal code on your computer or termux on your Cellphone

For computer/pc run this command :

-git status
-git add netlify.toml
-git commit -m "fix error"
-git push

for android/termux run this command :

-pkg update && pkg upgrade
-pkg install git
-git clone (paste link your repostory in here)
-cd (enter your repository name)
-git init
-git add netlify.toml
-git commit -m "fix error"
-git push origin
